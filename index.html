                <p>It’s important to use cocoa butter. It’s the key to more success, why not live smooth?</p>
                
                <p>You see that bamboo behind me though, you see that bamboo? Ain’t nothin’ like bamboo. Bless up. You should never complain, complaining is a weak emotion, you got life, we breathing, we blessed. It’s important to use cocoa butter.</p>

                <p>Congratulations, you played yourself. They don’t want us to eat. Another one. The first of the month is coming, we have to get money, we have no choice. It cost money to eat and they don’t want you to eat. You see that bamboo behind me though, you see that bamboo? Ain’t nothin’ like bamboo. Bless up. The key is to enjoy life, because they don’t want you to enjoy life. I promise you, they don’t want you to jetski, they don’t want you to smile. We the best. </p>

                <p> Learning is cool, but knowing is better, and I know the key to success. You do know, you do know that they don’t want you to have lunch. I’m keeping it real with you, so what you going do is have lunch.</p>

                <p>Every chance I get, I water the plants, Lion! Major key, don’t fall for the trap, stay focused. It’s the ones closest to you that want to see you fail.</p>
